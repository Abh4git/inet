Without starting the simulation which opens the TAP interfaces,
they don't have IPv6 link local addresses and babel daemons don't work.

You can check that the babeld deamons work by looking for UDP packets
send to port 6696.

The CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege requires for using network namespaces in INET.
Changing the network namespace requires CAP_SYS_ADMIN authority for the
'setns()' function in the 'inet::NetworkNamespaceContext' constructor.
The next commands adds this privilege to opp_run, so the all simulation
has the CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege, all simulations run with this privilege!!!
This is dangerous because it enables a thousand other things for all
running simulations, it becomes a big security hole.

$> sudo setcap cap_sys_admin+ep /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_release
$> sudo setcap cap_sys_admin+ep /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_dbg

For remove extra privileges after run the simulation, use next commands:

$> sudo setcap -r /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_release
$> sudo setcap -r /${your-omnetpp-root}/bin/opp_run_dbg
